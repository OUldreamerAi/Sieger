#  Sieger
##  Description  
**Sieger** is a short 2D adventure game made in **Godot** where you play as a boy who dreams of joining the Queen’s army.  
To prove yourself worthy, you’ll explore the world, talk to NPCs, and complete minigames to earn four special coins — each representing a knightly virtue. Bring them to the castle gate, and you’ll fulfill your dream of becoming a true knight!  

You can play the game here [**https://ouldreamer.itch.io/sieger**](https://ouldreamer.itch.io/sieger)

I wanted to make a small, story-driven adventure where exploration and personal growth matter more than combat.  
**Sieger** is about proving yourself — not just with a sword, but through loyalty, etiquette, and skill.
